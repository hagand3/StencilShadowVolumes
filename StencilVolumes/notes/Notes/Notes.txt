//BUGS:
	//camera drifts up slowly in POV camera mode.

//TODO:
	//Create separate shadow volumes buffer for z-pass
	//Add debug view inspector for lighting
	
//Optimizations:
	//Extend shadow volumes only as far as light radius (reduces fill-rate)
	
//Experimental:
	//Soft shadows through clustered light sources
	//Soft shadows through shadow volume jittering
